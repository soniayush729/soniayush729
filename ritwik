Dear Colleagues,

As known by everyone, the current project was quite successful and it is with great pleasure that I would like to invite you all for a team outing. Given below are the details of the outing that I have planned.

Date of Journey: From 15.11.2019 to 18.11.2019

Destination: Torna Fort

Accommodation: Bagpackers Hostel

The following things needs to be kept in mind for the whole duration of the trip:

You will take complete care of your travel, baggage and insurance.
You will be responsible for your safety and your belongings.
You will be responsible for any accidents or incidents that take place during the event.
Management has agreed to mark all the employees as “Present” for 18.11.2019 even though employees will not be present at work to attend to their duties.

So guys prepare yourself for an exciting time and come with all the things that you’ll require during the trip.

Regards,
